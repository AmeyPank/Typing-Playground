# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Typing App Setup

To create a typing app with Firebase integration, authentication, database (Firestore), user page (homepage), themes, and support for different modes (time and words), follow the steps below:

## Step 1: Create a new React app using Create React App
npx create-react-app typing-app


## Step 2: Install the required dependencies


## Step 3: Set up Firebase in your application

- Create a Firebase project on the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
- Install the Firebase CLI globally:


- Authenticate the Firebase CLI with your Google account:


- Initialize Firebase in your project:


Follow the prompts to select Firestore and enable hosting.

- Replace the contents of the `src/App.js` file with the Firebase initialization code and configuration.

## Step 4: Set up authentication using Firebase Authentication

- Enable the desired authentication methods (e.g., email/password, Google, etc.) in the Firebase console.
- Implement the authentication logic in your React components using the Firebase Authentication SDK.

## Step 5: Set up Firestore database

- Create a Firestore database in the Firebase console.
- Implement the necessary Firestore operations (e.g., reading and writing data) in your React components using the Firestore SDK.

## Step 6: Create user pages (homepage)

- Design and create the user pages (homepage) using React components.
- Implement the necessary functionality and data fetching using the Firebase Authentication and Firestore SDKs.

## Step 7: Implement themes using styled-components

- Define different theme styles using styled-components.
- Create a theme context to manage the current theme and provide it to the relevant components.

## Step 8: Implement modes (time and words)

- Create a context to manage the current mode (time or words).
- Update the relevant components to use the mode context and adjust their behavior accordingly.

## Step 9: Utilize React Hooks useMemo

- Identify components or calculations that can benefit from memoization using useMemo.
- Wrap the relevant code with useMemo to optimize performance.

## Step 10: Apply basic CSS using styled-components

- Define styled components with CSS styles for different elements and components.
- Use the styled components in your application to apply the desired styling.

Throughout the process, refer to the documentation and examples of the libraries and tools you are using (e.g., Firebase, React, styled-components) for more details on their usage and integration.
